		My favorite subjects are computers and digital phone even though they are hard. 
		In my free time i like to do alot of things. First i like going to the skatepark and i hope someday I can become good like Nolan Shoemaker and Dakota schuetz.
		I also like playing basketball for fun and I have been playing it for a long time. My favorite games are call of duty, Destiny and old school battlefront.
		I also like to airsoft and i want to get into competitive games. I am a huge fan of music and i dont remember a single day i havent listened to music.
		Im one of those people who has headphones 24/7 and I even carry extras in my backpack just in case I forget them. SOme of my favorite artists are: Logic,
		G-easy, Future, Kid Ink, Ty dolla sign, KB, Lecrae, Drake, and Linkin Park just to name a few. My favorite food is italian and i love Subway and 
		Panda Express. When i grow up i want to be a sound producer or a movie editor for a company like bad robot, Legendary, or Paramount.
