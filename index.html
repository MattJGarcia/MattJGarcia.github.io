<!-- You know an html doc by the presence of tags.
An open tag looks like this: <tag> and a close tag looks like this: </tag>.
An html element includes the open tag, the close tag, and the text in between them.
Every html document opens with a tag that specifies that it is html <!doctype html>
and another that opens the document <html>

An html document consists of two part: a head and a body. The head specifies
browser data that does not show on the actual page. It also links to other documents
used on the page like a CSS sheet or JS code. If you need more info on a particular
tag, element, or property - look it up on W3Schools-->
